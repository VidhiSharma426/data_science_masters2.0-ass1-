    "2. **Sample Size:**\n",
    "   - **Z-test:** It is more appropriate when the sample size is large (typically n > 30), as the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "   - **T-test:** It is often preferred when the sample size is small (less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",

In the context of a normal distribution, which is a bell-shaped curve, a Z-score of 1 is associated with the area under the curve to the right of the data point.

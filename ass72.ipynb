    "2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:\n",
    "   - SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three matrices: \\( U \\), \\( \\Sigma \\), and \\( V^T \\).\n",
    "   - The \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) matrices contain the left and right singular vectors, respectively, which are the eigenvectors of the matrix \\( A A^T \\) and \\( A^T A \\).\n",
    "   - The \\( \\Sigma \\) matrix contains the singular values, which are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \\( A A^T \\) and \\( A^T A \\).\n",
    "   - SVD finds applications in image compression, data compression, recommender systems, and latent semantic analysis.\n",

    "3. **Eigenfaces in Face Recognition**:\n",
    "   - Eigenfaces is a face recognition technique based on the Eigen-Decomposition approach.\n",
    "   - In Eigenfaces, a set of face images is decomposed into principal components using PCA, where each principal component represents an Eigenface.\n",
    "   - Face images are projected onto the Eigenspace spanned by the Eigenfaces, and distances between projected images are computed to determine similarity.\n",
    "   - Eigenfaces-based face recognition systems have been used in biometrics, security systems, and surveillance applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of how the Eigen-Decomposition approach is applied in data analysis and machine learning. Its utility extends to various other techniques and algorithms, including spectral clustering, graph embedding, eigenvalue centrality measures, and quantum machine learning algorithms. Eigen-Decomposition provides a foundational framework for understanding and manipulating matrices, enabling the development of sophisticated data analysis and machine learning methods."

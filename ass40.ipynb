A high variance model is very flexible and can capture intricate patterns in the training data, even noise or random fluctuations. However, it may perform poorly on new, unseen data because it has essentially memorized the training data and lacks the ability to generalize to different scenarios.\n",

Repeat this process K times, and average the performance metrics. Cross-validation helps assess how well the model generalizes to different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning Curves:**\n",
    "   - Plot the model's performance (e.g., training and validation error) against the number of training iterations or the size of the training dataset. Learning curves provide insights into whether the model is overfitting or underfitting. In overfitting, the training error decreases while the validation error increases, indicating the model is fitting noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Monitor key performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on both the training and validation datasets. A significant gap between training and validation performance may indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Residual Analysis:**\n",
    "   - For regression problems, analyze the residuals (the differences between predicted and actual values). Large residuals, especially patterns in the residuals, can indicate that the model is not capturing all the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Validation Set Performance:**\n",
    "   - Create a separate validation set and monitor the model's performance on this set. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, it might be overfitting.\n",

    "7. **Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "   - Systematically search through hyperparameter combinations using methods like grid search. This helps identify the set of hyperparameters that optimize model performance and avoid overfitting.\n",
